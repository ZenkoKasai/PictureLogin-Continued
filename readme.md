PictureLogin-Continued-Again [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.0-blue)](https://github.com/ZenkoKasai/PictureLogin-Continued/releases/tag/v.1.1.0)
===

This is a popular plugin for Minecraft servers (over 50,000 downloads) that has sadly been unsupported for a while.
I've updated it to 1.21.10 and will keep this repo public for anyone willing to dig far enough to find this version!

PictureLogin creates a fancy login message by displaying a picture of the player's head inside of chat.

Any support will need to be done through Github issues. If enough people download I may create a discord for support. I am very busy so hang tight if you need assistance!
